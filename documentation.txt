INSTRUCTIONS:
    movl A, B
        - moves literal value B into register A
    movr A, B
        - moves value in register B into register A
    addl A, B
        - adds literal value B into register A then stores the result into
          register A and register R
    addr A, B
        - adds value in register B into register A then stores the result
          into register A and register R
    subl A, B
        - subtracts literal value B from register A then stores the result
          into register A and register R
    subr A, B
        - subtracts value in register B from register A then stores the
          result into register A and register R
    mull A, B
        - multiplies literal value B into register A then stores the result into
          register A and register R
    mulr A, B
        - multiplies value in register B into register A then stores the result
          into register A and register R
    divl A, B
        - divides literal value B into register A then stores the result
          into register A and register R
    divr A, B
        - divides value in register B into register A then stores the
          result into register A and register R
    cmpr A, B
        - subtracts value in register B from register A then stores the
          result into register R
    cmpl A, B
        - subtracts literal value B from register A then stores the
          result into register R
    jmp A
        - sets instruction pointer to address A unconditionally
    jz A
        - sets instruction pointer to address A if value in register R is 0
    jnz A
        - sets instruction pointer to address A if value in register R is not
          0
    jl A
        - sets instruction pointer to address A if value in register R is
          less than 0
    jle A
        - sets instruction pointer to address A if value in register R is
          less than or equal to 0          
    jg A
        - sets instruction pointer to address A if value in register R is
          greater than 0
    jge A
        - sets instruction pointer to address A if value in register R is
          greater than or equal to 0
    call A
        - jumps to address of procedure A
    ret
        - jumps to address of the last executed call instruction
    pushl A
        - pushes literal value A to the stack
    pushr A
        - pushes value in register A to the stack
    popr A
        - pops value at the top of the stack and stores it in register A
    hlt
        - terminates the program

    All instructions are 5 bytes (1 byte for opcode, 2 bytes for each
    operand, even if there are none).
